## Tutorial

To get started, follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/tiredpixel/isoxya-docs/blob/latest/Tutorial.md).


## Documentation

The API uses REST and JSON, and [documentation](https://github.com/tiredpixel/isoxya-docs) is available as a repo.


## Dependencies

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (for `bin/` example scripts only)


## Installation

Compile and boot locally:

```sh
docker compose up
```

That's it! Now you've got a powerful web crawler and scraper at your disposal, extensible via plugins.

Images are also published using the `latest` tag (for development), and version-specific tags (for production). Do *not* use a `latest` tag in production!
